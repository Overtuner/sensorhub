Sensorhub in a nut shell - just a very basic documentation 

- What do i need:
1) A server ( i took the raspberry pi )
   With this hardware:
   - nRF24L01 wireless module
   With this software
   - Gnu c++ compiler
   - SQlite3 Database
   - rf24network (i found it here: https://github.com/farconada/RF24Network) (Doc: http://maniacbug.github.io/RF24Network/index.html)
   - a webserver (i use apache2) if you want to use the webinterface
2) A number of nodes 
   Minimal Hardware:
   - ATmega328P
   - nRF24L01 wireless module
   - opt: a sensor of your choice (or just simple a LED and a resistor to test a remote LED)
   - a battery to power it
3) A computer with the Arduino software (www.arduino.cc) to progrann the nodes

- How do i set it up
server:
1) install all required software
2) install the wireless module and make shure you have this files: "/dev/spidev0.0" "/dev/spidev0.1"
3) go to you sensorhub dir and run 
3.a) "git init"; "git pull https://github.com/wilmsn/sensornet.git"
3.b) "make"
4) if everything is OK run "sudo make install"
4a) you can control this service with "sudo service sensorhub <option>" option is one of "start" "stop" "clearlog"
5) configure the database, setup webpage, ...
node:
1) take some hardware and build it together
2) take a template from arduino folder and change it to your needs
3) programm the node using a USBASP adapter (Details here: http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/)
